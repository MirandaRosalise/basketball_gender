# basketball_gender

Repo for notebook(s) used in various basketball gender difference studies.

## Instructions for use
I've included a `requirements.txt` file for use with `pip`. You can replicate the environment this notebook was run in as follows
1. Clone the repo, then cd to the repo directory
2. Initialize the pip env with `python3 -m venv env` or similar.
3. `source env/bin/activate`
4. Finally, install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Contact the author if you have any issues with replication. You can contact me through my socials if you have those, or by opening an issue on this repo.
